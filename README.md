Clustering_Visualization_Tool
=============================



I make this tool which during my internship at LIPN. It allow you to visualize your data, especially clustering results, under differents angle.

At origin, it serve to visualize results of SOM algorithm but it can deserve others purposes.


## **Usage** ##
### Classic visualization ###
You have two files to upload, the first is a CSV file with a header **without "card"** feature, the second file is a one column file with "**card**" attribute as header
### Adjacency matrix ###
As previous, two files are necessary, the first is the adjacency matrix where you used space between values, second is a CSV file with header and a "**card**" attribute.
